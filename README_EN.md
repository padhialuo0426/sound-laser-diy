# Introduction
SoundLaserDIY is a pure hardware open-source project based on **ultrasonic parametric array**. It can modulate audio signals to ultrasonic frequencies and project sound directionally like a laser beam, creating a wonderful acoustic experience where "only specific locations can hear it". This project includes complete modulation circuit design and ultrasonic transducer array drive scheme, suitable for electronics enthusiasts and DIY enthusiasts for learning and practice.

# Principle
- **Carrier Generation**: A high-frequency square wave carrier with a center frequency of about 40kHz is generated by NE555 (U1).
- **PWM Modulation**: The audio signal is combined with the carrier to convert it into a pulse width modulation (PWM) signal.
- **Power Amplification**: Through TC4427 (U3-U12) high-speed driver chips, the weak signal is amplified to a power level sufficient to drive the transducer array.
- **Self-Demodulation**: When high-power ultrasound propagates in the air, due to the nonlinear characteristics of air, the signal undergoes self-demodulation, thereby restoring audible audio signals in the air.
